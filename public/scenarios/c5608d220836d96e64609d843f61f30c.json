{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The coyote swears to the german shepherd. The crab leaves the houses occupied by the german shepherd. The peafowl has 2 friends that are mean and three friends that are not. The peafowl was born one week ago. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Be careful when something borrows one of the weapons of the chihuahua and also acquires a photograph of the monkey because in this case it will surely not smile at the badger (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the crab leaves the houses occupied by the german shepherd, then the conclusion that \"the german shepherd borrows one of the weapons of the chihuahua\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: This is a basic rule: if the peafowl does not call the german shepherd, then the conclusion that the german shepherd smiles at the badger follows immediately and effectively. Rule4: If the worm does not invest in the company whose owner is the german shepherd however the coyote swears to the german shepherd, then the german shepherd will not borrow a weapon from the chihuahua. Rule5: If the peafowl has fewer than 7 friends, then the peafowl calls the german shepherd. Rule6: The peafowl will not call the german shepherd if it (the peafowl) has a card whose color starts with the letter \"y\". Rule7: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it is more than twenty months old then it calls the german shepherd for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2. Rule6 is preferred over Rule5. Rule6 is preferred over Rule7.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the german shepherd smile at the badger?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "c5608d220836d96e64609d843f61f30c", "level": "HighConflict"}
