{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The chihuahua has 78 dollars. The chihuahua was born three and a half years ago. The finch has a card that is red in color, is named Casper, and is a nurse. The seahorse has 48 dollars. The shark borrows one of the weapons of the german shepherd. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The chihuahua will call the elk if it (the chihuahua) has more money than the seahorse. Rule2: Regarding the finch, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it invests in the company whose owner is the elk. Rule3: The finch will not invest in the company whose owner is the elk if it (the finch) has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the dinosaur's name. Rule4: Regarding the chihuahua, if it is less than 13 months old, then we can conclude that it calls the elk. Rule5: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals hugs the seahorse, you can be certain that it will also build a power plant near the green fields of the llama. Rule6: Regarding the finch, if it works in computer science and engineering, then we can conclude that it invests in the company whose owner is the elk. Rule7: In order to conclude that elk does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the llama, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the finch invests in the company whose owner is the elk and secondly the chihuahua calls the elk. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6.
