The dachshund does not swim in the pool next to the house of the frog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If at least one animal manages to persuade the duck, then the swan does not borrow a weapon from the woodpecker. Rule2: If the frog does not hug the swan, then the swan borrows a weapon from the woodpecker. Rule3: In order to conclude that the frog will never hug the swan, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the chinchilla does not call the frog and secondly the dachshund does not swim in the pool next to the house of the frog. Rule4: The frog hugs the swan whenever at least one animal borrows a weapon from the beetle. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2.
