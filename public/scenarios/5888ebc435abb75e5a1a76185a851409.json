{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The dove has 17 dollars. The finch has 19 dollars. The fish reveals a secret to the poodle. The poodle has 60 dollars. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Here is an important piece of information about the poodle: if it has more money than the finch and the dove combined then it suspects the truthfulness of the bear for sure. Rule2: If something suspects the truthfulness of the bear, then it does not borrow one of the weapons of the badger. Rule3: One of the rules of the game is that if the fish reveals a secret to the poodle, then the poodle will never suspect the truthfulness of the bear. Rule4: There exists an animal which negotiates a deal with the bison? Then the poodle definitely borrows one of the weapons of the badger. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3.
