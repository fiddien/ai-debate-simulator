{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The bulldog suspects the truthfulness of the badger. The songbird creates one castle for the rhino. The wolf does not unite with the rhino. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Be careful when something does not shout at the german shepherd but stops the victory of the bison because in this case it will, surely, smile at the llama (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: There exists an animal which dances with the badger? Then the rhino definitely stops the victory of the bison. Rule3: For the rhino, if the belief is that the songbird creates one castle for the rhino and the wolf does not unite with the rhino, then you can add \"the rhino does not shout at the german shepherd\" to your conclusions. Rule4: There exists an animal which negotiates a deal with the chinchilla? Then the rhino definitely shouts at the german shepherd. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the rhino smile at the llama?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "51f04d6ac1cea47bf917fcea1d8cf3fd", "level": "LowConflict"}
