{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The pelikan hugs the seal but does not swim in the pool next to the house of the frog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something hugs the seal, then it borrows one of the weapons of the bear, too. Rule2: Are you certain that one of the animals borrows a weapon from the bear and also at the same time swears to the peafowl? Then you can also be certain that the same animal does not bring an oil tank for the mermaid. Rule3: If you are positive that one of the animals does not swim in the pool next to the house of the frog, you can be certain that it will swear to the peafowl without a doubt. Rule4: If the reindeer refuses to help the pelikan, then the pelikan brings an oil tank for the mermaid. Rule5: One of the rules of the game is that if the snake captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the pelikan, then the pelikan will never borrow one of the weapons of the bear. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pelikan bring an oil tank for the mermaid?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "6c97b07c40d11d6b05fc6acd636d42c4", "level": "LowConflict"}
