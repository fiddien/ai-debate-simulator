{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The crow has 45 dollars. The llama has a blade, and was born two years ago. The llama has a football with a radius of 28 inches. The owl has 2 dollars. The zebra borrows one of the weapons of the llama. The chihuahua does not bring an oil tank for the llama. The lizard does not neglect the llama. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The llama does not want to see the wolf, in the case where the lizard neglects the llama. Rule2: For the llama, if the belief is that the zebra borrows one of the weapons of the llama and the chihuahua does not bring an oil tank for the llama, then you can add \"the llama tears down the castle of the frog\" to your conclusions. Rule3: This is a basic rule: if the finch falls on a square of the llama, then the conclusion that \"the llama will not bring an oil tank for the dugong\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule4: The llama will want to see the wolf if it (the llama) has more money than the crow and the owl combined. Rule5: Are you certain that one of the animals does not want to see the wolf but it does tear down the castle that belongs to the frog? Then you can also be certain that this animal wants to see the snake. Rule6: Regarding the llama, if it is more than four and a half years old, then we can conclude that it wants to see the wolf. Rule7: The llama will bring an oil tank for the dugong if it (the llama) has a sharp object. Rule8: If the llama has a football that fits in a 54.1 x 55.5 x 62.7 inches box, then the llama brings an oil tank for the dugong. Rule9: Here is an important piece of information about the llama: if it has a device to connect to the internet then it does not tear down the castle of the frog for sure. Rule3 is preferred over Rule7. Rule3 is preferred over Rule8. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1. Rule9 is preferred over Rule2.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the llama want to see the snake?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "868fae73435a7b8d60b18bcd3dbb554b", "level": "HighConflict"}
