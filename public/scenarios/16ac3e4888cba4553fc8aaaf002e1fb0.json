{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The butterfly has 78 dollars. The pelikan has 74 dollars, and reduced her work hours recently. The pelikan is 2 years old. The woodpecker manages to convince the bear but does not build a power plant near the green fields of the mule. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the woodpecker pays some $$$ to the pelikan, then the pelikan is not going to call the mermaid. Rule2: If the pelikan is less than six years old, then the pelikan reveals a secret to the reindeer. Rule3: The living creature that manages to convince the bear will never pay money to the pelikan. Rule4: The pelikan will reveal a secret to the reindeer if it (the pelikan) has more money than the butterfly. Rule5: The living creature that does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the mule will pay some $$$ to the pelikan with no doubts. Rule6: If you see that something reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the reindeer and creates a castle for the seahorse, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also calls the mermaid. Rule5 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pelikan call the mermaid?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "16ac3e4888cba4553fc8aaaf002e1fb0", "level": "HighConflict"}
