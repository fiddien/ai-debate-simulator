The zebra has a bench, and has twelve friends. The walrus does not hide the cards that she has from the peafowl. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something invests in the company whose owner is the crab and leaves the houses that are occupied by the chihuahua, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also dances with the finch. Rule2: The living creature that swims in the pool next to the house of the monkey will also leave the houses that are occupied by the chihuahua, without a doubt. Rule3: If the zebra has more than eight friends, then the zebra stops the victory of the monkey. Rule4: In order to conclude that the peafowl invests in the company whose owner is the crab, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the walrus does not hide the cards that she has from the peafowl and secondly the vampire does not enjoy the company of the peafowl. Rule5: The zebra will not stop the victory of the monkey if it (the zebra) has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the zebra: if it has a device to connect to the internet then it does not stop the victory of the monkey for sure. Rule5 is preferred over Rule3.
