{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The crab has 13 dollars. The dinosaur has 78 dollars. The leopard has 12 dollars. The swallow stops the victory of the husky but does not want to see the starling. The stork does not hide the cards that she has from the bison. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something stops the victory of the husky and does not want to see the starling, then it suspects the truthfulness of the dinosaur. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the stork hides her cards from the bison, then the conclusion that \"the bison swears to the dinosaur\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the dinosaur: if it has more money than the leopard and the crab combined then it does not destroy the wall constructed by the bee for sure. Rule4: For the dinosaur, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the swallow suspects the truthfulness of the dinosaur and 2) the bison swears to the dinosaur, then you can add \"dinosaur trades one of its pieces with the peafowl\" to your conclusions.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the dinosaur trade one of its pieces with the peafowl?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "2c31e5f69d3012a005fccd95b8b11149", "level": "LowConflict"}
