The swallow is watching a movie from 1983, and stops the victory of the dalmatian. The wolf is watching a movie from 1972, and is a marketing manager. The swallow does not shout at the mannikin. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the swallow smiles at the cougar and the camel does not manage to convince the cougar, then the cougar will never manage to convince the bee. Rule2: Regarding the camel, if it is watching a movie that was released after the French revolution began, then we can conclude that it does not manage to persuade the cougar. Rule3: If the wolf works in healthcare, then the wolf trades one of the pieces in its possession with the cougar. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the wolf: if it is watching a movie that was released before the Internet was invented then it trades one of the pieces in its possession with the cougar for sure. Rule5: Are you certain that one of the animals does not shout at the mannikin but it does stop the victory of the dalmatian? Then you can also be certain that this animal smiles at the cougar.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cougar manage to convince the bee?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "dcdfb70cf892882bdbf9ad530a6b913d", "level": "LowConflict"}
