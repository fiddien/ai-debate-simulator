{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The dragonfly disarms the wolf. The dragonfly is a software developer. The swan has a card that is violet in color, and negotiates a deal with the woodpecker. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the swan has something to sit on, then the swan does not pay some $$$ to the mannikin. Rule2: The mannikin does not trade one of its pieces with the rhino whenever at least one animal tears down the castle that belongs to the finch. Rule3: The living creature that negotiates a deal with the woodpecker will also pay money to the mannikin, without a doubt. Rule4: Regarding the swan, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"i\", then we can conclude that it does not pay money to the mannikin. Rule5: The living creature that does not disarm the wolf will smile at the mannikin with no doubts. Rule6: For the mannikin, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the swan pays some $$$ to the mannikin and 2) the dragonfly smiles at the mannikin, then you can add \"mannikin trades one of its pieces with the rhino\" to your conclusions. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the mannikin trade one of its pieces with the rhino?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "68fb90f6350de4b804c1c1dad37fe85e", "level": "HighConflict"}
