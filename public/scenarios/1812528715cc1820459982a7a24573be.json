Rule4: Are you certain that one of the animals suspects the truthfulness of the ostrich and also at the same time suspects the truthfulness of the poodle? Then you can also be certain that the same animal refuses to help the fangtooth. Rule5: Regarding the frog, if it is watching a movie that was released after the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it suspects the truthfulness of the ostrich. Rule6: Regarding the frog, if it has more money than the beetle, then we can conclude that it suspects the truthfulness of the ostrich. Rule7: In order to conclude that frog does not suspect the truthfulness of the poodle, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the flamingo invests in the company owned by the frog and secondly the bear brings an oil tank for the frog.
