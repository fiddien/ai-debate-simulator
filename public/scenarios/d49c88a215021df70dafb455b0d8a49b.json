{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The chinchilla creates one castle for the wolf. The chinchilla has a basketball with a diameter of 27 inches, and is watching a movie from 1997. The elk swims in the pool next to the house of the chinchilla. The reindeer shouts at the chinchilla. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something dances with the monkey and calls the gorilla, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not hide her cards from the mule. Rule2: If the chinchilla has a basketball that fits in a 30.2 x 35.3 x 35.2 inches box, then the chinchilla dances with the monkey. Rule3: In order to conclude that the chinchilla calls the gorilla, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the elk should swim inside the pool located besides the house of the chinchilla and secondly the reindeer should shout at the chinchilla. Rule4: Regarding the chinchilla, if it is watching a movie that was released before the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it does not dance with the monkey. Rule5: The chinchilla will not dance with the monkey if it (the chinchilla) is in Germany at the moment. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the chinchilla hide the cards that she has from the mule?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "d49c88a215021df70dafb455b0d8a49b", "level": "HighConflict"}
