Rule4: The poodle will not shout at the gadwall if it (the poodle) is less than 6 years old. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the poodle: if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the woodpecker's name then it does not shout at the gadwall for sure. Rule6: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals shouts at the gadwall, you can be certain that it will not create a castle for the bison. Rule7: Are you certain that one of the animals brings an oil tank for the walrus and also at the same time swears to the bulldog?
