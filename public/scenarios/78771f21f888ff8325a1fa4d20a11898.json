{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The finch has a basketball with a diameter of 30 inches, and is currently in Berlin. The lizard refuses to help the dachshund. The lizard swims in the pool next to the house of the chinchilla. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the finch, if it is in Germany at the moment, then we can conclude that it does not smile at the songbird. Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the finch: if it has a basketball that fits in a 24.9 x 39.5 x 39.5 inches box then it does not smile at the songbird for sure. Rule3: For the songbird, if the belief is that the snake does not negotiate a deal with the songbird and the finch does not smile at the songbird, then you can add \"the songbird builds a power plant near the green fields of the shark\" to your conclusions. Rule4: If something refuses to help the dachshund and swims inside the pool located besides the house of the chinchilla, then it suspects the truthfulness of the crow. Rule5: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, suspects the truthfulness of the crow, then the songbird is not going to build a power plant close to the green fields of the shark. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the songbird build a power plant near the green fields of the shark?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "78771f21f888ff8325a1fa4d20a11898", "level": "LowConflict"}
