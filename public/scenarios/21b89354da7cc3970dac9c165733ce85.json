{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The crow enjoys the company of the crab. The frog has a 11 x 13 inches notebook. The frog reduced her work hours recently, and will turn three years old in a few minutes. The goat swears to the chihuahua. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something disarms the llama and disarms the peafowl, then it destroys the wall constructed by the seahorse. Rule2: If at least one animal swears to the chihuahua, then the flamingo creates a castle for the mannikin. Rule3: If the frog works fewer hours than before, then the frog does not borrow a weapon from the mannikin. Rule4: If the frog has a notebook that fits in a 7.8 x 9.3 inches box, then the frog does not borrow a weapon from the mannikin. Rule5: There exists an animal which enjoys the companionship of the crab? Then the mannikin definitely disarms the llama. Rule6: The frog will borrow one of the weapons of the mannikin if it (the frog) has more than 9 friends. Rule7: The frog will borrow a weapon from the mannikin if it (the frog) is less than 1 year old. Rule8: If the flamingo creates one castle for the mannikin and the frog does not borrow one of the weapons of the mannikin, then the mannikin will never destroy the wall constructed by the seahorse. Rule1 is preferred over Rule8. Rule6 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4. Rule7 is preferred over Rule3. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the mannikin destroy the wall constructed by the seahorse?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "21b89354da7cc3970dac9c165733ce85", "level": "LowConflict"}
