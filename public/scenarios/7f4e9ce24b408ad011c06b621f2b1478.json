Rule2: Regarding the dachshund, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it calls the woodpecker. Rule3: The dachshund enjoys the company of the bison whenever at least one animal dances with the liger. Rule4: Regarding the dachshund, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the dragon's name, then we can conclude that it does not acquire a photo of the seal. Rule5: If you see that something acquires a photograph of the seal but does not call the woodpecker, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not enjoy the company of the bison. Rule6: If the stork suspects the truthfulness of the butterfly, then the butterfly dances with the liger. Rule7: If the dachshund has more money than the coyote and the husky combined, then the dachshund acquires a photo of the seal. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5.
