{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The basenji swears to the llama. The chihuahua is named Teddy. The duck is named Tango. The poodle is currently in Berlin. The swan invests in the company whose owner is the poodle. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The duck will smile at the poodle if it (the duck) has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the chihuahua's name. Rule2: One of the rules of the game is that if the basenji swears to the llama, then the llama will never take over the emperor of the poodle. Rule3: In order to conclude that the poodle calls the cougar, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the llama does not take over the emperor of the poodle and secondly the duck does not create a castle for the poodle. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the poodle: if it is in Germany at the moment then it negotiates a deal with the leopard for sure. Rule5: The poodle does not borrow a weapon from the dugong, in the case where the swan invests in the company whose owner is the poodle.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the poodle call the cougar?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "90052351bd7b5ac482e9798bb1d5bcd6", "level": "LowConflict"}
