{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The flamingo enjoys the company of the songbird. The gorilla has a basketball with a diameter of 16 inches, and is currently in Montreal. The liger brings an oil tank for the mouse but does not suspect the truthfulness of the beetle. The liger does not swear to the cobra. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Here is an important piece of information about the gorilla: if it is in Italy at the moment then it smiles at the pigeon for sure. Rule2: The gadwall does not hide the cards that she has from the owl whenever at least one animal smiles at the pigeon. Rule3: The living creature that borrows one of the weapons of the mouse will also destroy the wall built by the gadwall, without a doubt. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the gorilla: if it has a notebook that fits in a 23.4 x 22.2 inches box then it smiles at the pigeon for sure. Rule5: This is a basic rule: if the flamingo enjoys the companionship of the songbird, then the conclusion that \"the songbird calls the gadwall\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule6: For the gadwall, if the belief is that the songbird calls the gadwall and the liger destroys the wall constructed by the gadwall, then you can add \"the gadwall hides her cards from the owl\" to your conclusions. Rule6 is preferred over Rule2.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the gadwall hide the cards that she has from the owl?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "eced42550a1f6fa49707c6e533fe0d44", "level": "LowConflict"}
