{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The badger invests in the company whose owner is the frog. The frog has some kale. The leopard unites with the beaver. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, unites with the beaver, then the worm is not going to negotiate a deal with the frog. Rule2: If at least one animal takes over the emperor of the dinosaur, then the frog does not bring an oil tank for the camel. Rule3: One of the rules of the game is that if the badger invests in the company whose owner is the frog, then the frog will, without hesitation, bring an oil tank for the camel. Rule4: If you see that something does not pay money to the camel but it brings an oil tank for the camel, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also invests in the company owned by the chinchilla. Rule5: Regarding the frog, if it has a leafy green vegetable, then we can conclude that it does not pay money to the camel. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the frog invest in the company whose owner is the chinchilla?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "proved", "id": "59e443c34ea0954d24024498704e64e6", "level": "LowConflict"}
