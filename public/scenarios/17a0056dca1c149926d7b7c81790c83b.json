{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The bison refuses to help the butterfly but does not swear to the crow. The cobra refuses to help the basenji. The flamingo is a web developer. The reindeer creates one castle for the dragonfly, and has a card that is green in color. The reindeer has a cappuccino. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the reindeer, if it has a card whose color appears in the flag of Netherlands, then we can conclude that it falls on a square that belongs to the shark. Rule2: If something enjoys the company of the dragonfly, then it does not fall on a square that belongs to the shark. Rule3: The shark does not build a power plant near the green fields of the finch whenever at least one animal refuses to help the seahorse. Rule4: For the shark, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the bison does not surrender to the shark and 2) that the reindeer does not tear down the castle that belongs to the shark, then you can add shark builds a power plant close to the green fields of the finch to your conclusions. Rule5: There exists an animal which tears down the castle that belongs to the basenji? Then, the bison definitely does not refuse to help the shark. Rule6: The flamingo will refuse to help the seahorse if it (the flamingo) works in marketing. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the shark build a power plant near the green fields of the finch?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "17a0056dca1c149926d7b7c81790c83b", "level": "HighConflict"}
