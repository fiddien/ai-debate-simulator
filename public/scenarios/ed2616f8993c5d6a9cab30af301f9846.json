The peafowl has a banana-strawberry smoothie. The peafowl is watching a movie from 2017. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the camel, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that peafowl does not fall on a square that belongs to the camel and 2) that german shepherd reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the camel, then you can add camel will never refuse to help the ostrich to your conclusions. Rule2: The peafowl will not fall on a square of the camel if it (the peafowl) has something to drink. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it is watching a movie that was released before Shaquille O'Neal retired then it does not fall on a square that belongs to the camel for sure. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the german shepherd: if it is less than 3 years old then it reveals a secret to the camel for sure. Rule5: If the german shepherd has a card whose color appears in the flag of Belgium, then the german shepherd reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the camel.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the camel refuse to help the ostrich?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "ed2616f8993c5d6a9cab30af301f9846", "level": "LowConflict"}
