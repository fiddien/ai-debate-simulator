{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The gorilla has 7 friends, and invented a time machine. The gorilla has a 11 x 16 inches notebook, and has a card that is white in color. The shark captures the king of the dinosaur. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The bulldog invests in the company owned by the butterfly whenever at least one animal captures the king of the dinosaur. Rule2: Regarding the gorilla, if it has a notebook that fits in a 6.2 x 18.4 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not destroy the wall built by the cobra. Rule3: Regarding the gorilla, if it has a card whose color appears in the flag of France, then we can conclude that it destroys the wall constructed by the cobra. Rule4: This is a basic rule: if the bee stops the victory of the bulldog, then the conclusion that \"the bulldog will not invest in the company owned by the butterfly\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule5: The living creature that destroys the wall built by the cobra will never take over the emperor of the owl. Rule6: Regarding the gorilla, if it has more than 17 friends, then we can conclude that it destroys the wall built by the cobra. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule2.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the gorilla take over the emperor of the owl?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "d859cf431a257c1791071e4715c894d1", "level": "HighConflict"}
