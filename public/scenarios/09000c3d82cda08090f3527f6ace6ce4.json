{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The basenji has eleven friends, and is 23 months old. The dinosaur creates one castle for the zebra but does not take over the emperor of the zebra. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The basenji will shout at the dugong if it (the basenji) has fewer than five friends. Rule2: For the dugong, if the belief is that the dinosaur is not going to hide her cards from the dugong but the basenji shouts at the dugong, then you can add that \"the dugong is not going to surrender to the mermaid\" to your conclusions. Rule3: The basenji will shout at the dugong if it (the basenji) is more than 36 weeks old. Rule4: If you see that something does not take over the emperor of the zebra but it creates a castle for the zebra, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it is not going to hide her cards from the dugong.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the dugong surrender to the mermaid?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "09000c3d82cda08090f3527f6ace6ce4", "level": "LowConflict"}
