{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The llama has a card that is orange in color. The crow does not swear to the seal. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If at least one animal swims inside the pool located besides the house of the bison, then the crow does not refuse to help the bear. Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the llama: if it took a bike from the store then it does not swim in the pool next to the house of the bison for sure. Rule3: From observing that an animal does not swear to the seal, one can conclude that it hides her cards from the ant. Rule4: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals hides her cards from the ant, you can be certain that it will also refuse to help the bear. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the llama: if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors then it swims in the pool next to the house of the bison for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule2 is preferred over Rule5.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the crow refuse to help the bear?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "54b86326729f3697f5e9e4e2956aa867", "level": "HighConflict"}
