{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The beetle captures the king of the badger, and tears down the castle that belongs to the fish. The pelikan has a hot chocolate, and invented a time machine. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Are you certain that one of the animals tears down the castle of the fish and also at the same time captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the badger? Then you can also be certain that the same animal wants to see the bear. Rule2: Regarding the pelikan, if it created a time machine, then we can conclude that it swears to the liger. Rule3: If the pelikan swears to the liger and the songbird does not hug the liger, then the liger will never suspect the truthfulness of the goat. Rule4: If the pelikan has a sharp object, then the pelikan swears to the liger. Rule5: There exists an animal which suspects the truthfulness of the dalmatian? Then, the pelikan definitely does not swear to the liger. Rule6: The liger suspects the truthfulness of the goat whenever at least one animal wants to see the bear. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the liger suspect the truthfulness of the goat?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "proved", "id": "ac252485b9867f4db31bc72ed3a01411", "level": "HighConflict"}
