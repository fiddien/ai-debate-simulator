{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The camel has 2 dollars. The goose has 55 dollars. The mouse has 88 dollars, and has a plastic bag. The mouse is currently in Frankfurt. The reindeer dances with the seahorse, and refuses to help the seal. The reindeer is a grain elevator operator, and is currently in Toronto. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the mouse has a leafy green vegetable, then the mouse refuses to help the peafowl. Rule2: If the reindeer works in healthcare, then the reindeer builds a power plant near the green fields of the peafowl. Rule3: For the peafowl, if the belief is that the mouse is not going to refuse to help the peafowl but the reindeer builds a power plant near the green fields of the peafowl, then you can add that \"the peafowl is not going to enjoy the company of the chihuahua\" to your conclusions. Rule4: The reindeer will build a power plant near the green fields of the peafowl if it (the reindeer) is in Canada at the moment. Rule5: Regarding the mouse, if it has more money than the goose and the camel combined, then we can conclude that it does not refuse to help the peafowl. Rule6: If you see that something refuses to help the seal and dances with the seahorse, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the peafowl. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule6. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the peafowl enjoy the company of the chihuahua?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "d9758623a5a0276d346c22b6941ecfd7", "level": "HighConflict"}
