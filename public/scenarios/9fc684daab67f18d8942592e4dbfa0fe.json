{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The ant pays money to the wolf. The dolphin has a computer, and is watching a movie from 1776. The dolphin has a football with a radius of 25 inches. The dolphin supports Chris Ronaldo. The dove has 20 dollars. The wolf has 76 dollars, and is 24 months old. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the dolphin, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the gorilla falls on a square of the dolphin and 2) the wolf does not smile at the dolphin, then you can add that the dolphin will never stop the victory of the mouse to your conclusions. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the german shepherd does not take over the emperor of the dolphin, then the conclusion that the dolphin hugs the dugong follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: Regarding the dolphin, if it has a basketball that fits in a 20.5 x 22.8 x 22.4 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not hug the dugong. Rule4: If the ant pays money to the wolf, then the wolf is not going to invest in the company whose owner is the dolphin. Rule5: If something invests in the company owned by the dinosaur and does not hug the dugong, then it stops the victory of the mouse. Rule6: Regarding the dolphin, if it has a device to connect to the internet, then we can conclude that it invests in the company whose owner is the dinosaur. Rule7: Regarding the dolphin, if it is watching a movie that was released after the French revolution began, then we can conclude that it does not invest in the company owned by the dinosaur. Rule8: Here is an important piece of information about the wolf: if it is less than 12 months old then it invests in the company whose owner is the dolphin for sure. Rule9: Here is an important piece of information about the wolf: if it has more money than the pigeon and the dove combined then it invests in the company whose owner is the dolphin for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule5. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule7. Rule8 is preferred over Rule4. Rule9 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the dolphin stop the victory of the mouse?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "9fc684daab67f18d8942592e4dbfa0fe", "level": "HighConflict"}
