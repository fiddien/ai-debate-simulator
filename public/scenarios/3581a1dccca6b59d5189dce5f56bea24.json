{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The akita tears down the castle that belongs to the reindeer. The bison has 82 dollars, has a cello, and is watching a movie from 1924. The bison invests in the company whose owner is the pigeon. The chinchilla is a dentist. The snake has 15 dollars. The swallow has 106 dollars. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The bison will not trade one of its pieces with the dove if it (the bison) is watching a movie that was released before world war 2 started. Rule2: There exists an animal which tears down the castle of the reindeer? Then the mannikin definitely pays money to the bison. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the chinchilla: if it works in healthcare then it stops the victory of the bison for sure. Rule4: The living creature that invests in the company owned by the pigeon will never hug the shark. Rule5: In order to conclude that the bison enjoys the companionship of the swan, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the mannikin should pay money to the bison and secondly the chinchilla should stop the victory of the bison. Rule6: Regarding the bison, if it has more money than the snake and the swallow combined, then we can conclude that it does not trade one of its pieces with the dove. Rule7: Regarding the bison, if it has a musical instrument, then we can conclude that it hugs the shark. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bison enjoy the company of the swan?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "proved", "id": "3581a1dccca6b59d5189dce5f56bea24", "level": "LowConflict"}
