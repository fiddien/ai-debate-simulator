{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cougar parked her bike in front of the store, and reveals a secret to the elk. The owl has 1 friend, and surrenders to the liger. The worm calls the starling, and has eight friends. The worm has a card that is orange in color. The cougar does not stop the victory of the frog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the worm has more than 14 friends, then the worm unites with the monkey. Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the cougar: if it is watching a movie that was released after the Berlin wall fell then it does not negotiate a deal with the bison for sure. Rule3: Be careful when something reveals a secret to the elk and also stops the victory of the frog because in this case it will surely negotiate a deal with the bison (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals surrenders to the liger, you can be certain that it will also unite with the monkey. Rule5: There exists an animal which negotiates a deal with the bison? Then the monkey definitely reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the cobra. Rule6: Regarding the owl, if it works in marketing, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the monkey. Rule7: The living creature that calls the starling will never unite with the monkey. Rule8: Regarding the worm, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it unites with the monkey. Rule9: Regarding the owl, if it has more than two friends, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the monkey. Rule10: Here is an important piece of information about the cougar: if it took a bike from the store then it does not negotiate a deal with the bison for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule7. Rule3 is preferred over Rule10. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule4 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule9. Rule8 is preferred over Rule7.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the monkey reveal a secret to the cobra?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "c4a98ac0e14a12d2a5e9b2dc665690fc", "level": "HighConflict"}
