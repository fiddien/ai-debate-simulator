The chinchilla has 21 dollars. The cobra is named Cinnamon. The elk has 59 dollars. The otter is named Chickpea. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the bulldog is watching a movie that was released after the first man landed on moon, then the bulldog does not suspect the truthfulness of the lizard. Rule2: If the cobra has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the otter's name, then the cobra builds a power plant close to the green fields of the lizard. Rule3: The bulldog will not suspect the truthfulness of the lizard if it (the bulldog) has more money than the chinchilla and the elk combined. Rule4: For the lizard, if the belief is that the cobra builds a power plant close to the green fields of the lizard and the bulldog does not take over the emperor of the lizard, then you can add \"the lizard creates one castle for the reindeer\" to your conclusions.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the lizard create one castle for the reindeer?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "e9233cdd962d02121ce91756c1fdc102", "level": "LowConflict"}
