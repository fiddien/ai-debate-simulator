{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The dinosaur captures the king of the seahorse. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals destroys the wall constructed by the starling, you can be certain that it will not stop the victory of the bee. Rule2: The living creature that captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the seahorse will also stop the victory of the bee, without a doubt. Rule3: One of the rules of the game is that if the worm does not reveal a secret to the pelikan, then the pelikan will never shout at the dachshund. Rule4: If at least one animal stops the victory of the bee, then the pelikan shouts at the dachshund. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Rule3 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pelikan shout at the dachshund?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "proved", "id": "7762c76170c9d8866f03e3fc08d94b2e", "level": "HighConflict"}
