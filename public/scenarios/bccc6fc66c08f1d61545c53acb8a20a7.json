{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cobra calls the badger. The dugong hides the cards that she has from the wolf. The poodle brings an oil tank for the lizard. The wolf has a basketball with a diameter of 26 inches, and has a card that is red in color. The wolf has a low-income job. The monkey does not disarm the wolf. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something does not acquire a photograph of the akita and also does not fall on a square of the dalmatian, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also calls the shark. Rule2: If at least one animal calls the badger, then the lizard does not borrow one of the weapons of the wolf. Rule3: This is a basic rule: if the dugong hides the cards that she has from the wolf, then the conclusion that \"the wolf will not acquire a photograph of the akita\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule4: Regarding the wolf, if it has a basketball that fits in a 34.7 x 35.2 x 28.7 inches box, then we can conclude that it falls on a square of the dalmatian. Rule5: One of the rules of the game is that if the monkey does not disarm the wolf, then the wolf will, without hesitation, acquire a photograph of the akita. Rule6: If the wolf has a high salary, then the wolf falls on a square that belongs to the dalmatian. Rule7: For the wolf, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the butterfly dances with the wolf and 2) the lizard borrows a weapon from the wolf, then you can add \"wolf will never call the shark\" to your conclusions. Rule8: This is a basic rule: if the poodle brings an oil tank for the lizard, then the conclusion that \"the lizard borrows one of the weapons of the wolf\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule9: The wolf will not fall on a square that belongs to the dalmatian if it (the wolf) has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5. Rule7 is preferred over Rule1. Rule8 is preferred over Rule2. Rule9 is preferred over Rule4. Rule9 is preferred over Rule6.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the wolf call the shark?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "proved", "id": "bccc6fc66c08f1d61545c53acb8a20a7", "level": "HighConflict"}
