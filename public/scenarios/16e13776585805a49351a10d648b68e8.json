{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The bison has 63 dollars. The goose has 14 friends, and is watching a movie from 1992. The gorilla has 100 dollars. The gorilla has a card that is indigo in color. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the gorilla, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it stops the victory of the goose. Rule2: If the goose has more than nine friends, then the goose unites with the badger. Rule3: Regarding the goose, if it is watching a movie that was released after the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the badger. Rule4: One of the rules of the game is that if the gorilla negotiates a deal with the goose, then the goose will, without hesitation, suspect the truthfulness of the lizard. Rule5: The gorilla will stop the victory of the goose if it (the gorilla) has more money than the bison. Rule6: If something does not shout at the badger, then it does not suspect the truthfulness of the lizard. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule4 is preferred over Rule6.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the goose suspect the truthfulness of the lizard?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "16e13776585805a49351a10d648b68e8", "level": "HighConflict"}
