{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The ostrich assassinated the mayor. The ostrich is currently in Ottawa, and was born 11 months ago. The frog does not acquire a photograph of the ostrich. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something neglects the camel and does not smile at the worm, then it dances with the starling. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the frog does not acquire a photograph of the ostrich, then the conclusion that the ostrich will not smile at the worm follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: The ostrich does not dance with the starling, in the case where the bison surrenders to the ostrich. Rule4: The ostrich will not neglect the camel if it (the ostrich) is in Canada at the moment. Rule5: If the ostrich is less than 25 months old, then the ostrich neglects the camel. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the ostrich: if it has fewer than 11 friends then it smiles at the worm for sure. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule3 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the ostrich dance with the starling?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "2d5795e57ded035e4358dbf645b410f2", "level": "HighConflict"}
