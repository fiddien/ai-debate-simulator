{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The goat is named Teddy. The pigeon is named Luna. The pigeon is currently in Argentina. The swan destroys the wall constructed by the coyote. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The pigeon will swear to the shark if it (the pigeon) is in Italy at the moment. Rule2: There exists an animal which destroys the wall constructed by the coyote? Then the pigeon definitely calls the zebra. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the pigeon: if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the goat's name then it swears to the shark for sure. Rule4: The living creature that swears to the shark will also swear to the seal, without a doubt. Rule5: The living creature that swears to the frog will never call the zebra. Rule6: Be careful when something does not manage to convince the snake but calls the zebra because in this case it certainly does not swear to the seal (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2 is preferred over Rule5. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pigeon swear to the seal?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "e29cad2cf40000a6a8bcaa1929c70d67", "level": "LowConflict"}
