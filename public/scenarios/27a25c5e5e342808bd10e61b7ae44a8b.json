{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The beaver has a card that is red in color, and is two years old. The beaver negotiates a deal with the bear. The dove disarms the stork. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, disarms the stork, then the owl is not going to disarm the poodle. Rule2: In order to conclude that the poodle captures the king of the akita, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the beaver should invest in the company owned by the poodle and secondly the pelikan should disarm the poodle. Rule3: Be careful when something negotiates a deal with the bear and also tears down the castle of the beetle because in this case it will surely not invest in the company whose owner is the poodle (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: If the owl does not disarm the poodle, then the poodle does not capture the king of the akita. Rule5: If the beaver has a card with a primary color, then the beaver invests in the company whose owner is the poodle. Rule6: The beaver will invest in the company whose owner is the poodle if it (the beaver) is more than 3 years old. Rule2 is preferred over Rule4. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the poodle capture the king of the akita?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "27a25c5e5e342808bd10e61b7ae44a8b", "level": "HighConflict"}
