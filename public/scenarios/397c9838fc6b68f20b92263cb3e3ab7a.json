{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The fish tears down the castle that belongs to the pigeon but does not borrow one of the weapons of the dachshund. The monkey negotiates a deal with the chinchilla. The worm calls the chinchilla. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: There exists an animal which reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the beetle? Then the cougar definitely takes over the emperor of the akita. Rule2: For the cougar, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the fish negotiates a deal with the cougar and 2) the bee trades one of its pieces with the cougar, then you can add \"cougar will never take over the emperor of the akita\" to your conclusions. Rule3: The chinchilla unquestionably reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the beetle, in the case where the worm calls the chinchilla. Rule4: Be careful when something tears down the castle that belongs to the pigeon but does not borrow a weapon from the dachshund because in this case it will, surely, negotiate a deal with the cougar (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: There exists an animal which negotiates a deal with the chinchilla? Then the bee definitely trades one of the pieces in its possession with the cougar. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cougar take over the emperor of the akita?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "397c9838fc6b68f20b92263cb3e3ab7a", "level": "LowConflict"}
