Rule3: Regarding the walrus, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it calls the otter. Rule4: If something surrenders to the mannikin and calls the fish, then it swims in the pool next to the house of the cougar. Rule5: If the walrus has a football that fits in a 49.8 x 50.7 x 51.3 inches box, then the walrus does not call the otter. Rule6: The walrus will not swim inside the pool located besides the house of the cougar if it (the walrus) has fewer than 8 friends. Rule2 is preferred over Rule4. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5.
