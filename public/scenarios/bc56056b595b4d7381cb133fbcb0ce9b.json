{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The coyote has a football with a radius of 18 inches. The coyote is currently in Colombia. The gorilla brings an oil tank for the seal. The gorilla hides the cards that she has from the zebra. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the coyote, if it is in South America at the moment, then we can conclude that it takes over the emperor of the dolphin. Rule2: If something does not swim inside the pool located besides the house of the crab but brings an oil tank for the seal, then it will not pay some $$$ to the dolphin. Rule3: The coyote will take over the emperor of the dolphin if it (the coyote) has a football that fits in a 35.6 x 32.4 x 42.6 inches box. Rule4: From observing that one animal hides the cards that she has from the zebra, one can conclude that it also pays some $$$ to the dolphin, undoubtedly. Rule5: In order to conclude that dolphin does not reveal a secret to the ostrich, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the coyote takes over the emperor of the dolphin and secondly the gorilla pays some $$$ to the dolphin. Rule2 is preferred over Rule4.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the dolphin reveal a secret to the ostrich?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "bc56056b595b4d7381cb133fbcb0ce9b", "level": "LowConflict"}
