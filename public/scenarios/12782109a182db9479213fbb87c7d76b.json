{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The zebra hides the cards that she has from the gorilla. The fish does not stop the victory of the gorilla. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If at least one animal manages to convince the dinosaur, then the bee swears to the mouse. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the gorilla falls on a square of the bee, then the conclusion that \"the bee will not swear to the mouse\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: In order to conclude that the gorilla falls on a square that belongs to the bee, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the zebra should hide her cards from the gorilla and secondly the fish should not stop the victory of the gorilla. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bee swear to the mouse?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "12782109a182db9479213fbb87c7d76b", "level": "LowConflict"}
