{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The dragon neglects the ostrich. The goose leaves the houses occupied by the fangtooth, and lost her keys. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals leaves the houses that are occupied by the fangtooth, you can be certain that it will also unite with the bulldog. Rule2: The coyote reveals a secret to the bulldog whenever at least one animal neglects the ostrich. Rule3: For the bulldog, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the goose unites with the bulldog and 2) the coyote reveals a secret to the bulldog, then you can add \"bulldog will never suspect the truthfulness of the stork\" to your conclusions. Rule4: If at least one animal pays some $$$ to the worm, then the bulldog suspects the truthfulness of the stork. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bulldog suspect the truthfulness of the stork?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "d32aeca05cc4b93ed9e8f1812b1156b6", "level": "HighConflict"}
