{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The akita brings an oil tank for the cougar, and will turn 25 weeks old in a few minutes. The dragonfly is watching a movie from 1952, and swears to the rhino. The dragonfly does not fall on a square of the bear. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals brings an oil tank for the cougar, you can be certain that it will also negotiate a deal with the leopard. Rule2: Be careful when something does not fall on a square that belongs to the bear but swears to the rhino because in this case it will, surely, shout at the llama (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the dragonfly: if it is watching a movie that was released before Zinedine Zidane was born then it does not shout at the llama for sure. Rule4: The leopard wants to see the dalmatian whenever at least one animal shouts at the llama. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the leopard want to see the dalmatian?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "proved", "id": "7b1eaaa73d68287a5b2b2216b8b6fd6f", "level": "HighConflict"}
