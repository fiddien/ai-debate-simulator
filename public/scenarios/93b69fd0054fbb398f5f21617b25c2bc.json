{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The akita hides the cards that she has from the duck. The dolphin unites with the akita. The gorilla swears to the zebra. The zebra reveals a secret to the lizard. The akita does not manage to convince the monkey. The rhino does not trade one of its pieces with the akita. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The living creature that does not manage to persuade the monkey will never swear to the snake. Rule2: The zebra does not take over the emperor of the akita, in the case where the gorilla swears to the zebra. Rule3: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals hides her cards from the duck, you can be certain that it will not suspect the truthfulness of the frog. Rule4: If you see that something does not swear to the snake but it suspects the truthfulness of the frog, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it is not going to capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the finch. Rule5: If the akita created a time machine, then the akita swears to the snake. Rule6: In order to conclude that the akita suspects the truthfulness of the frog, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the rhino does not trade one of its pieces with the akita and secondly the dolphin does not unite with the akita. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the akita capture the king of the finch?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "93b69fd0054fbb398f5f21617b25c2bc", "level": "HighConflict"}
