{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The basenji hides the cards that she has from the coyote. The reindeer takes over the emperor of the dragonfly. The snake has a card that is red in color. The snake is currently in Ottawa. The mouse does not borrow one of the weapons of the snake. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals surrenders to the bee, you can be certain that it will not shout at the leopard. Rule2: In order to conclude that the snake does not suspect the truthfulness of the goose, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly that the mouse will not borrow one of the weapons of the snake and secondly the akita shouts at the snake. Rule3: The snake suspects the truthfulness of the goose whenever at least one animal takes over the emperor of the dragonfly. Rule4: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, falls on a square that belongs to the coyote, then the snake acquires a photo of the bear undoubtedly. Rule5: If you see that something suspects the truthfulness of the goose and acquires a photo of the bear, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also shouts at the leopard. Rule1 is preferred over Rule5. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the snake shout at the leopard?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "unknown", "id": "d6682cea7cfa34c45622bc6ff81810b7", "level": "HighConflict"}
