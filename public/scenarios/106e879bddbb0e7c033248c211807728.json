{"situation": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The gadwall leaves the houses occupied by the coyote. The husky brings an oil tank for the reindeer. The seal hides the cards that she has from the dachshund, and was born 3 and a half years ago. The seal wants to see the monkey. The wolf hates Chris Ronaldo. The wolf is a school principal. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something wants to see the monkey and hides her cards from the dachshund, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not smile at the gadwall. Rule2: If the wolf does not manage to persuade the gadwall and the seal does not smile at the gadwall, then the gadwall will never unite with the camel. Rule3: Regarding the wolf, if it works in education, then we can conclude that it does not manage to convince the gadwall. Rule4: This is a basic rule: if the leopard does not unite with the wolf, then the conclusion that the wolf manages to persuade the gadwall follows immediately and effectively. Rule5: If the wolf is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then the wolf does not manage to convince the gadwall. Rule6: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals leaves the houses that are occupied by the coyote, you can be certain that it will also want to see the duck. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5.", "question": "Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the gadwall unite with the camel?", "answer_options": ["proved", "disproved", "unknown"], "label": "disproved", "id": "106e879bddbb0e7c033248c211807728", "level": "HighConflict"}
